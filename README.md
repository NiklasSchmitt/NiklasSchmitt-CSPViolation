# NiklasSchmitt-CSPViolation
This is a Znuny package to collect [Content-Security-Policy](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#content-security-policy) violations.

The Content-Security-Policy of the framework will be enhanced with the `report-uri` directive which sends violations to a webservice. This webservice logs violations with `info`-level into Znuny Log.

## Prerequisites
 - Znuny LTS 6.5.x

## Configuration
No additional configuration is needed.

The required Znuny webservice will be installed and configured within the package installation.
